Workers' Comp Claims Predictive Modeling Dashboard

### [LIVE DEMO](https://tychobra.shinyapps.io/wc-pm-dashboard/)

This Shiny application uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to predict claim status at age 2 and incremental claim payments from age 1 to age 2.  Simulations are run using each claim's predicted values to derive confidence levels.
